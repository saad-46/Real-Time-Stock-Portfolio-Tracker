### Phase 1 (Now - 30 min):
1. ✅ Fix voice error (DONE)
2. Create basic split-screen login
3. Add placeholder for images
4. Fix empty boxes

### Phase 2 (Next - 1 hour):
5. Download real images from internet
6. Add circular voice button
7. Improve responsive layout

### Phase 3 (Final - 1 hour):
8. Polish everything
9. Add animations
10. Perfect the design
