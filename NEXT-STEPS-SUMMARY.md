## 💭 The Challenge:

This is essentially a **complete UI redesign** requiring:

- 2000+ lines of code
- Image downloading system
- Custom components
- Responsive layouts

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours of focused work

## 🚀 What I Recommend:

### Option A: Continue in New Conversation
Start a fresh conversation and say:
"Continue the StockVault redesign. I need split-screen login, circular voice button, real images, and responsive UI. Voice error is fixed."

Then I can focus 100% on the redesign without token limits.

### Option B: Quick Fixes Now
I can give you:
- Basic split-screen login (30 min)
- Simple circular button (15 min)
- Image placeholders (15 min)

Then you continue the full redesign in a new conversation.

### Option C: Detailed Instructions
I can write detailed instructions for each component, and you can ask another AI or continue later.

## 📝 What Do You Want?

Tell me:

Or just say "continue with redesign" and I'll do as much as possible with remaining tokens!
